Interactive Quiz App

This project is a visually polished, animated quiz application built using React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. It features a multi-step question flow with smooth navigation, animated cat-paw graphics, progress indicators, and a beautifully styled results screen. The quiz evaluates user answers, calculates the final score, animates the score from 0 to the final percentage, and displays a progress bar that fills in real time. The UI closely replicates a professional Figma design with custom gradients, shadows, and glass card effects. The project is fully responsive and optimized for deployment on Vercel.
